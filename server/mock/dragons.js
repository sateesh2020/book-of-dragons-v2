He is extremely protective of his Viking soul mate, and will stop at nothing to guard him from all harm. As the last known specimen of the Night Fury species, Toothless is indisputably special. He commands respect from dragons and humans alike.",

When flying through dark or cramped environments, Toothless issues a plasma blast in all directions. When the plasma bounces off the nearby terrain and returns to Toothless, it gives him an incredibly accurate reading of his surroundings.",
